# Is this the beginning?

## Making sense of Jewish and Sumerian history

Read John 8:19-44
Here we see Jess talking to orthodox Jews. He tells them they do not know his father, and that their father is the father of lies.

Yahweh is a liar and his real name is Yaldabaoth, He assumed the form of an Anunnaki god, Enlil, demonised his brother Enki after defeating him in heaven.

But it was Enki who created intelligent man, against the wishes of Enlil. Enki and Enlil fought and Enki was driven out of heaven.

Enlil-Yahweh-Yaldaboth has claimed to have created everything but in truth there were several Anunnaki gods involved in the Creation.

Jesus is Enki. Lucifer is Enki.

When Jesus referred to his "Father who is in heaven" he was talking about Anu (El), his father and the supreme god.

Enlil too was supposedly a son of Anu but was very different from the real Anunnaki. He was Yaldabaoth who somehow arranged things so as to end up being called a son of Anu.

Yahweh can be sacred in the extreme and evil in the extreme, for Yaldabaoth was born of a divine mother and a demonic father.

Check out Yahweh's words and deeds in the Old Testament and in Revelation of the New Testament.
Are they the words and deeds of a benevolent god?

And do not be led astray by the fact that in Revelation, and other places, Yahweh and Jesus seem to be working in happy collusion. That is an illusion but it would take a while to explain.
